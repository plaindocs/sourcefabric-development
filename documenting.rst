Documenting
===========

At Sourcefabric documentation is as important as writing code. We do care 
about writing software in the best possible way, but that is not enough. 
Writing precise documentation makes the software easier use. 

Documenting is similar to coding, as you need to invest time on structuring,
composing, testing, fixing, updating, etc.

You can help us in all this process in a few different ways:

- Documenting new features
- Translating
- Reporting issues
- Fixing issues

Getting started with Sphinx and reST
------------------------------------

Developer documentation is usually written in `reStructuredText <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_ and hosted on `Github <http:www.github.com>`_. The HTML output is generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, hosted on `Read the Docs <http://www.readthedocs.org>`_ and shown to the world at `http://docs.sourcefabric.org <http://docs.sourcefabric.org>`_.

* Read the `Sphinx Tutorial <http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html>`_.
* Learn the `reStructuredText Syntax <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_.

Configuring Read the Docs
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sourcefabric projects on Read the Docs are configured in a central account `sourcefabric`, talk to Holman or Samuel about this.

When adding a project, leave most settings on the default except for:

* `Project URL`: Use a project specific URL such as `https://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/`.
* `Tags`: FIXME
 
Advanced Settings:

* `Python configuration file`:

Subprojects:

Change this setting in the main `Sourcefabric project <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/sourcefabric/>`_ and add the new project as a subproject to it. 

Notifications:

Add Sam and the maintainer of the project documentation.

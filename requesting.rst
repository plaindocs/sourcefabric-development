Requesting features
===================

At Sourcefabric, we are always looking for ways to improve our software,
and your ideas are an essential part of this process. Here you
can find how to submit feature requests to our issue tracker http://dev.sourcefabric.org. 

- Add feature requests to our issue tracker, in the User Requests milestone
  for the relevant project. The Project and Innovations teams in Sourcefabric
  keep an eye on all submitted requests.
- The more information you provide the better. Describe the feature and the reason 
  for the request clearly. Providing a set of use cases is always helpful.
- If the feature gets accepted it will be pushed to the roadmap and added to
  one of the upcoming major releases.
- If you are a programmer and you want to implement the feature yourself, that
  will make us happy. Code contribution is always welcome. Follow the
  guidelines here: :ref:`coding`
- If you have already started working on the feature, show us your code! Good
  code speaks for itself, and gives you the best chance to get it accepted.
- After making a feature request, pay attention to the ticket you created in 
  the issue tracker, our development team will probably start a conversation
  and give you some valuable feedback.

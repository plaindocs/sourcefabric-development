Development @ Sourcefabric
==========================

*At Sourcefabric we develop open-source software for media organizations.*

There are several reasons why we develop open-source software, one of our
favourites is the chance to work with the people who use our software. 
Whether you are a journalist, a student a writer or a programmer, you can 
contribute and help us to develop better software.

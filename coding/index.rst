Writing code
============

Joining the community of developers and contributing code is a great way to
meet other developers, develop your programming skills and make your work
more visible.

Contributing code to any Sourcefabric project -- whether a new
feature or a bug fix -- is simple:

1. Fork and clone the project repository in GitHub.
2. Work on the code and push back to your fork.
3. Submit a Pull Request. For more details on the process, read :ref:`git`.

.. admonition:: Found a security hole?

   If you have found a security vulnerability, please report it only by
   sending an e-mail to security@sourcefabric.org. The security team will
   process the request before making a public announcement. For further
   information on this please read our Security policy page.

We love getting bug reports - it means you are using our software!

Anyone can submit a bug report to our issue tracker http://dev.sourcefabric.org. 
Creating valid well written bug reports is very helpful to the Quality Assurance team
and developers, so please keep the following hints in mind.

Before creating a bug report
-----------------------------

- Check if someone else has already reported the same issue by searching 
  the issue tracker. Do not give up at the first attempt, also use the 
  advanced search. Keeping the issue tracker as clean as possible and 
  avoiding duplicate issues is really important.
- If there is already an open ticket reporting the same issue, please
  contribute by adding as much information as you can, especially if you think
  it would help us to easily reproduce the problem.
- Do not create a ticket if you are not certain the issue is a bug, ask in the
  forums. Our developers constantly follow conversations and answer questions 
  there.
- Do not use the issue to ask questions, that's what the forums are for.

When creating a bug report
-----------------------------

- Well-written reports are extremely important. By writing them you are helping us
  understand and reproduce issues. 
- We like bug reports that:

  - Report only one bug per ticket. Including different issues in the same
    report makes things less readable and much harder for us.
  - Provide a complete, concise and clear description of the issue.
  - Provide a set of detailed steps to reproduce it.
  - Provide details on the specific platform you are using: browser and browser
    version, operating system, Web server setup, etc.
  - Provide as much relevant extra information as possible (e.g. 
    messages from error logs and exception backtraces.)

- There is no need to write in the forums that you have reported a bug. Every
  time you report a bug developers are automatically notified.

.. TODO: Once you have reported a bug,  more likely you want to know what will happen next. Here you can read how we process a ticket and understand its lifecycle.


.. _requesting:

Requesting New Features
------------------------

At Sourcefabric we are always looking for ways to improve our software,
and your ideas are an essential part of this process. Here you
can find how to submit feature requests to our issue tracker http://dev.sourcefabric.org. 

- Add feature requests to our issue tracker, in the User Requests milestone
  for the relevant project. The Project and Innovations teams in Sourcefabric
  keep an eye on all submitted requests.
- The more information you provide the better. Describe the feature and the reason 
  for the request clearly. Providing a set of use cases is always helpful.
- If the feature gets accepted it will be pushed to the roadmap and added to
  one of the upcoming major releases.
- If you are a programmer and you want to implement the feature yourself, that
  will make us happy. Code contribution is always welcome. Follow the
  guidelines here: :ref:`coding`
- If you have already started working on the feature, show us your code! Good
  code speaks for itself, and gives you the best chance to get it accepted.
- After making a feature request, pay attention to the ticket you created in 
  the issue tracker, our development team will probably start a conversation
  and give you some valuable feedback.

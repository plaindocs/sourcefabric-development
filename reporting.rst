Reporting issues
================

.. admonition:: Found a security hole?

   If you have found a vulnerability issue, please report it only by
   sending an e-mail to security@sourcefabric.org. The security team will
   process the request before making a public announcement. For further
   information on this please read our Security policy page.

We love getting bug reports - it means you are using our software!

Anyone can submit a bug report to our issue tracker http://dev.sourcefabric.org. 
Creating valid well written bug reports is very helpful to the Quality Assurance team
and developers, so please keep the following hints in mind.

*Before creating a bug report*:

- Check if someone else has already reported the same issue by searching 
  in the issue tracker. Do not give up at the first attempt, also use the 
  advanced search. Keeping the issue tracker as clean as possible and 
  avoiding duplicate issues is really important for us.
- If there is already an open ticket reporting the same issue, please
  contribute by adding as much information as you can, especially if you think
  it would help us to easily reproduce the problem.
- Do not create a ticket if you are not certain the issue is a bug. Ask in the
  forums. Our developers are constantly following conversations and answering
  questions.
- Do not use the issue to ask questions, that's what the forums are for.

*When creating a bug report*:

- Well-written reports are extremely important. By writing them you are helping us
  understand and reproduce issues. 
- We like bug reports that:

  - Report only one bug per ticket. Including different issues in the same
    report makes things less readable and much harder for us.
  - Provide a complete, concise and clear description of the issue.
  - Provide a set of detailed steps to reproduce it.
  - Provide details on the specific platform you are using: browser and browser
    version, operating system, Web server setup, etc.
  - Provide as much relevant extra information as possible (e.g. 
    messages from error logs and exception backtraces.)
- There is no need to write in the forums that you have reported a bug. Every
  time you report a bug, developers are automatically notified.

.. TODO: Once you have reported a bug,  more likely you want to know what will happen next. Here you can read how we process a ticket and understand its lifecycle.
